        <h1>Best Fried chicken recipe (really)</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>First you need a chicken. If you <strong>don't</strong> have one in your garden, you should buy it. In fact you <strong>absolutely</strong> need it if you want to eat fried chicken.</p>
        <p><strong>but</strong> please don't buy it fried <em>because it would be stupid....</em></p>
        <p>then you need <strong>oil</strong> the one you always use to fry food, the unhealty one, the one that makes you fat and nearer to death.</p>
